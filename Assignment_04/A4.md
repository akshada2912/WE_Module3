The 1980s saw a shift from Natural Language Processing techniques aiming to codify the grammatical rules of natural language towards techniques aiming to use statistical models to generate text. One early idea which technically isn’t “AI” seeing as it is “memorizing” the training data and yet introduces us to the power contained in statistical techniques of text generation is the idea of Markov chains. Write a python function generate(filename: str, start_words: list[str], chain_length: int, num_generated: int) -> str which takes a filename, a chain length, a list of start words which has to be exactly as long as the chain_length (why?), and an integer num_generated and returns a sentence num_generated words long which sounds similar to the text contained in filename.

Sure, here's a Python function that generates text using Markov chains:

python
Copy code
import random

def build_markov_chain(filename, chain_length):
    markov_chain = {}
    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        words = file.read().split()
        for i in range(len(words) - chain_length):
            key = tuple(words[i:i + chain_length])
            value = words[i + chain_length]
            if key in markov_chain:
                markov_chain[key].append(value)
            else:
                markov_chain[key] = [value]
    return markov_chain

def generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated):
    markov_chain = build_markov_chain(filename, chain_length)
    current_words = tuple(start_words)
    generated_text = list(current_words)

    for _ in range(num_generated):
        if current_words in markov_chain:
            next_word = random.choice(markov_chain[current_words])
            generated_text.append(next_word)
            current_words = tuple(generated_text[-chain_length:])
        else:
            break

    return ' '.join(generated_text)

#Example usage
filename = 'your_text_file.txt'
start_words = ['The', 'quick']
chain_length = 2
num_generated = 10
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)
Replace 'your_text_file.txt' with the path to your text file. This function builds a Markov chain based on the text in the file and then generates a sentence using the specified number of words (num_generated) starting from the given words (start_words). The chain_length parameter determines how many previous words are considered when predicting the next word.

# User
I don't have a text file-can you create a corpus and generate text to use?
# ChatGPT
Sure! Let's create a simple corpus and use it to generate text. Here's a sample corpus and the updated function to generate text:

python
Copy code
import random

#Sample corpus
corpus = """
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The lazy dog sleeps all day.
All that glitters is not gold.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
"""

#Save the corpus to a text file
with open('corpus.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    file.write(corpus)

def build_markov_chain(filename, chain_length):
    markov_chain = {}
    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        words = file.read().split()
        for i in range(len(words) - chain_length):
            key = tuple(words[i:i + chain_length])
            value = words[i + chain_length]
            if key in markov_chain:
                markov_chain[key].append(value)
            else:
                markov_chain[key] = [value]
    return markov_chain

def generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated):
    markov_chain = build_markov_chain(filename, chain_length)
    current_words = tuple(start_words)
    generated_text = list(current_words)

    for _ in range(num_generated):
        if current_words in markov_chain:
            next_word = random.choice(markov_chain[current_words])
            generated_text.append(next_word)
            current_words = tuple(generated_text[-chain_length:])
        else:
            break

    return ' '.join(generated_text)

#Example usage
filename = 'corpus.txt'
start_words = ['The', 'quick']
chain_length = 2
num_generated = 10
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)
This will generate text based on the provided corpus. You can adjust the corpus and parameters as needed for your application.

# User 
Can you give me some test cases for this?


# ChatGPT
Sure, here are some test cases you can use to test the build_markov_chain and generate functions:

Test case with small corpus:

Corpus: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Start words: ['The', 'quick']
Chain length: 2
Number of generated words: 10
Test case with longer corpus:

Corpus: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog sleeps all day. All that glitters is not gold. A penny saved is a penny earned."
Start words: ['All', 'that']
Chain length: 2
Number of generated words: 15
Test case with a larger chain length:

Corpus: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog sleeps all day. All that glitters is not gold. A penny saved is a penny earned."
Start words: ['All']
Chain length: 3
Number of generated words: 20
Test case where start words are not present in the corpus:

Corpus: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Start words: ['Fox', 'jumps']
Chain length: 2
Number of generated words: 10
Test case with a chain length greater than the number of words in the corpus:

Corpus: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Start words: ['The']
Chain length: 10
Number of generated words: 20
You can use these test cases to ensure that your functions handle different scenarios correctly and produce the expected output.

# User
Can you give me code to test this?
# ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's how you can implement the test cases using the provided functions:

python
Copy code
#Test case 1
print("Test case 1:")
filename = 'corpus.txt'
start_words = ['The', 'quick']
chain_length = 2
num_generated = 10
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)

#Test case 2
print("\nTest case 2:")
filename = 'corpus.txt'
start_words = ['All', 'that']
chain_length = 2
num_generated = 15
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)

#Test case 3
print("\nTest case 3:")
filename = 'corpus.txt'
start_words = ['All']
chain_length = 3
num_generated = 20
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)

#Test case 4
print("\nTest case 4:")
filename = 'corpus.txt'
start_words = ['Fox', 'jumps']
chain_length = 2
num_generated = 10
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)

#Test case 5
print("\nTest case 5:")
filename = 'corpus.txt'
start_words = ['The']
chain_length = 10
num_generated = 20
generated_sentence = generate(filename, start_words, chain_length, num_generated)
print(generated_sentence)
Just copy and paste this code into your Python environment and run it to execute the test cases. You should see the output for each test case printed to the console.
